Grading is not over yet(?) and I'm still owing blog posts -.-\|\|\| BUT the projects are over and the module culminated on the night of the STEPS. I've been thinking about what I have learned through the projects and experience, and what I could have done better.

Before the semester started, we were all required to write about what we expected to learn through this module. Looking back, I was really naive. I wanted to do both design and coding - indeed I tried both - only to find out I'm not good at either. I guess knowing that there's so much room to improve and how to improve is much better than simply *thinking* and *assuming*. Before I started working on the first assignment, I didn't even know what's a Single Page App is, but after 3 projects with Angular (1 of which is Angular 2), I think I'm slightly more comfortable with Angular. Anyways,had I known what I was in for, I definitely would have started the preparation earlier. Again, i was too naive. 

Next to the goal of trying out new tech and working with new people. For the design part I found Sketch handy, and for the coding part I'm getting familiar with Angular 2 and Typescript. The decision of using Angular 2 for the final project gave us so much headache, but I'm still glad we tried it out. I'm also grateful for the people I worked with thoughout all the projects. Most of them are more experienced with web development than I am, and I really learned a LOT from them. 

I used to make excuses that there's not enough time. I told myself that if I had time I would learn JS thoroughly, or that I would learn the reasoning behind instead of just copying a working solution from stackoverflow. But I may never have the ideal blocks of free time that I want. So it is important to learn by doing and don't put off learning. 

If given a second chance, I would still take 3216 :)
